## Introduction
In this project, we combine the power of Python for backend development, GraphQL for efficient data fetching, and React for building dynamic user interfaces. The backend is responsible for handling requests, managing data, and serving the API, while the frontend focuses on displaying data and interacting with the user.

## Technologies Used
- **Python**: A versatile and widely used programming language for backend development.
- **GraphQL**: A query language for APIs that provides a more efficient and flexible alternative to RESTful APIs.
- **React**: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- **Apollo Client**: A powerful GraphQL client for React that simplifies data fetching and state management.
- **Django**: A high-level Python web framework that provides a solid foundation for building web applications.
- **Django GraphQL**: A Django plugin that integrates GraphQL into a Django project.

## Getting Started
To get started with this project, follow the steps below.

### Backend Setup
1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the `app` directory.
3. Create a virtual environment: `python3 -m venv venv`.
4. Configure the database settings in `app/app/settings.py`.
5. Apply the database migrations: `python manage.py migrate`.
6. Start the backend server: `python manage.py runserver`.

### Frontend Setup
1. TO DO

## Usage
Once you have completed the setup steps, you can access the full stack website by visiting `http://localhost:3000` in your web browser. The backend server will be running on `http://localhost:8000`.

Feel free to explore the code and modify it according to your needs. You can add new features, customize the UI, or integrate additional libraries as required.
